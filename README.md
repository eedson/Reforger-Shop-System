## Reforger Shop System

## Description
This mod adds an expandable shop system to Arma Reforger, and eventually Arma 4. Current features include buying items using a currency, or bartering with other items. The system is designed to be expandable which allows new types of merchandise to be added if the system doesn't currently support it, as well as new types of payment methods. 

Currently the system allows two types of payment methods: item, and currency. As well as two types of shops: physical shop, and a traditional UI based shop. Physical shops display the merchandise being sold as they normally apear in the world, and UI shops display all items in list.

You can use this mod as a dependency from the released version on the workshop, or you can incorporate the code into your own codebase.
